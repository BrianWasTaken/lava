* **Controls** - Musicord comes up with either **text** or **reaction** controls if you're lazy enough to re-type commands.
* **Interface** - Clean interface means nice work and nice work means the developer spent countless times for this hardwork scraping and finding the best embed styles for this stupid bot.
* **Integration** - The bot uses [**top.gg**](https://top.gg) for voting your bot and [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com) for premium commands.
