## Features

- **Spawner** - Spawn events on a channel to earn $$$ (not real ones, ok?).
- **Games** - Gambling games, fight or spam games, on the go.

## Self-Hosting

Although the full code is visible and is available here to self-host on any compatible machine, I wouldn't mind you hosting your own. Just don't host a public version of this bot for you or somebody including you as an interest.

## Install

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/BrianWasTkn/lava.git`
2. Open up your terminal and change your dir into lava: `cd lava`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm i`
4. Since Lava's source is made with typescript, build the source code: `npm run build`
5. Copy `.env-example` and rename it to `.env` and fill out the fields
6. Run the bot something: `npm run start` or `node build/lava`
