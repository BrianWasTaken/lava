	<h1>Musicord</h1>
	<p>An awesome music bot, providing the best music experience in your Discord server. Enjoy **10+** cool music effects and music from **700+** music sources!</p>
</div>

## Features
The bot has the following features available to improve your music experience. Some features are plug-and-use but some of it needs to be made.

* **Effects** - Listen to music with special effects like **bassboost**, **nightcore**, **karaoke** and **10+ more**.
* **DJ** - Allow users with the **DJ** role or your own to control the Musicord.
* **Controls** - Musicord comes up with either **text** or **reaction** controls if you're lazy enough to re-type commands.
* **Interface** - Clean interface means nice work and nice work means the developer spent countless times for this hardwork scraping and finding the best embed styles for the music player.
* **Integration** - The bot uses [**top.gg**](https://top.gg) for voting your bot and [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com) for premium commands.
