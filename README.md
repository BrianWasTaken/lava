## Features

- **Currency** - A currency system (based on [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol) discord bot)
- **Spawner** - On-the-spot events to join to get some credits.

## Motivation
Dank Memer. First of all, I'd like to thank [Melmsie](https://github.com/melmsie) for inspiring me as a beginner developer because of his passion with coding and breaking everything. I consider Lava as my first successful bot (or node app in general) and I say I've done very good.

## Name Theory
The name "Lava" originated for "flowing into your server needs" and I admit, that wasn't a very good description for this bot after all since it's just a currency bot with a few paint of moderation so yeah.

## Self-Hosting

Though the source code is visible here, please make sure you won't host a public version of this bot for you or with a certain group including you as an interest or for any other stuff. It's only intended for a private server at the moment and will change in the future.
