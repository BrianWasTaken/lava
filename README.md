# Musicord
An awesome music bot, providing the best music experience in your Discord server. Enjoy **10+** cool music effects and music from **700+** music sources!

## Features
The bot has the following features available to improve your music experience. Some features are plug-and-use but some of it needs to be made.

* **Effects** - Listen to music with special effects like **bassboost**, **nightcore**, **karaoke** and **10+ more**.
* **DJ** - Allow users with the **DJ** role to control the music player.
* **Controls** - Each command can be controlled by **text** or **reactions** so you can save time typing the commands.
* **Listeners** - Dynamic event listeners to listen for both **Discord** and **player** events.
* **Commands** - Commands are built with **classes** so **cooldowns** and **permission checkers** are initiated automatically.
