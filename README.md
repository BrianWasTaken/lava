# Depracation Notice
This branch has no longer been maintained for months and will never be, forever. This branch won't be deleted until further notice.
I don't mind you self-hosting this branch but some packages might've been outdated already so if you're decent, you could update it then.

### Visibility
This branch is visible for many purposes:
* **Frameworks** - The use of frameworks (such as [discord-akairo](https://discord-akairo.github.io)) made my work easier here.
Soon, I'll be making my own handlers and do own dirty work. I'm not saying I don't like akairo. I just wanna learn more and screw my brain up.
* **Structure** - One of the things that dragged me into this sh\*t is how I could organize those functions/classes and make them readable as clear as possible.
I have my own ways of typing, shh.
* **Syntax** - I just love the use of ES6 `import`s and `class`es. Prototypical and the `const...require` syntaxes are in my opinion, disgusting.

### Why TS?
Go with the trend! Learn new shit, break many shits. Static typing and the powerful intellisense in my IDE helps very much. 
Plus typescript compiles from early versions of the JS engine into the latest ones so it suits for any environment.
