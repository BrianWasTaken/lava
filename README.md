# Lava
A multi-purpose discord bot for utilizing unique games and events for your [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol 'Visit site')-based discord server.

### Features
* **Spawner** - A spawner that can spawn events on a channel.
* **Music** - Uses lavalink for playing music which is coming soon.
* **Games** - Some fun games, inspired by some other froggy and danky bot out there.

### Install
Install all required dependencies for node:
```bash
$ npm i
```

### Self-Hosting
You are **not allowed to host a public version** of this bot anywhere elsewhere since it's only compatible for one server. Lava has it's own specific config file for where X will go, or Y will do.
