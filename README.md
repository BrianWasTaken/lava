## Features

- **Currency** - A currency system (based on [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol))
- **Spawner** - On-the-spot events to join to get some credits.

## Self-Hosting

Although the full code is visible and is available here to self-host on any compatible machine, I wouldn't mind you hosting your own. Just don't host a public version of this bot for you or somebody including you as an interest.
