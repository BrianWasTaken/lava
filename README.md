## Features
* **Spawner** - Spawn events on a channel to earn $$$ (not real ones, ok?).
* **Games** - Gambling games, fight or spam games, on the go.

## Self-Hosting
Although the full code is visible here and is available to self-host on any compatible machine, I wouldn't mind you hosting your own version. But please, don't host a public version of this bot. The main reason is lava is not fully dependent to databases yet. So the functionality and everything still depends to the [local config](./src/config.ts) for easy import.

## Install
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/BrianWasTkn/lava.git`
2. Open up your terminal and change your dir into lava: `cd lava`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm i`
4. Since Lava's source is made with typescript, build the source code: `npm run build`
5. Run the bot something: `npm run start` or `node build/lava`
6. Done.
