# Packages
These packages are the main packages I used during the time of writing Musicord. These modules are responsible of how Musicord will work.

`discord.js`, `DisTube`

* **Musicord** - *sub-libraries*
`oppusscript`, `lyrics-finder`, `string-progressbar`, `ffmpeg-static`

* **Source** - *typings and logging*
`esm`, `chalk`, `my brain.exe stopped working`
